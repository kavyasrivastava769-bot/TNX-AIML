# Track C — ML Fundamentals: Week 1 Checklist

**Track C** is for members who already have some Python and want to start machine learning properly.
This week first **brushes up the three core libraries — numpy, pandas, matplotlib — one library per
day**, each with the video's own dataset and capstone worksheet, and then covers **ML fundamentals**:
what ML is, the types of ML, EDA, data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering/selection.
Every day ends with a hands-on deliverable. Flip each `- [ ]` to `- [x]` as you finish, then commit
your changes in your own fork.

**Week:** Mon 12 Oct 2026 → Mon 19 Oct 2026 · **7 topic days** (Mon–Sun) + a review Monday.
**Days 1–3 — library brush-up (one library a day):**

**Watch:** [numpy — Complete Data Science Course (2 h)](https://youtu.be/Utgwk0r9Zq4)
**Dataset & capstone:** the video description links [AkarshVyas/Numpy-Youtube](https://github.com/AkarshVyas/Numpy-Youtube),
which contains `Arrays.ipynb`, `array_indexing.ipynb`, `array_operations.ipynb`, and the **`exersises.ipynb` worksheet**.

- [ ] **Notebooks (setup)** — `0:28` · get Jupyter/Colab running. Why it matters: every day this week runs in a notebook.
- [ ] **NumPy arrays** — `19:28` · creating arrays, `shape`, `dtype`, `arange`/`linspace`. Why it matters: the whole data stack rests on arrays.
- [ ] **Indexing & slicing** — `46:57` · selecting rows, columns, and blocks of an array. Why it matters: reading data starts with selecting it.
- [ ] **Array operations & broadcasting** — `1:04:12` · element-wise maths and how numpy aligns shapes. Why it matters: the core pattern behind nearly every numeric operation.
- [ ] **Complete the `exersises.ipynb` worksheet** — `1:30:01` · the exercise set at the end of the video. Why it matters: it is the day's hands-on test.
- **Deliverable:** your completed `exersises.ipynb` plus the Day 1 answers in [`worksheet/day-1.md`](worksheet/day-1.md).

## Day 2 — Tuesday 13 Oct 2026 — pandas

- [ ] **Missing data** — `35:20` · detecting, dropping, and filling missing values. Why it matters: real datasets are incomplete.
- [ ] **Merging, joining & concatenation** — `45:33` and **group-by / pivot tables** — `57:46` and `1:08:02`. Why it matters: combining and summarising tables is most of data work.

which contains `IPL.csv`, the plot notebooks, and the **`IPL_Capstone_Project.ipynb`** worksheet.

- [ ] **Matplotlib basics** — `5:29` · line, bar, and scatter plots with labels and titles. Why it matters: a picture is the fastest way to check your data.
- [ ] **Distribution, categorical & matrix plots** — `41:21`, `1:05:57`, `1:23:36`, and **regression plots** — `1:37:09`. Why it matters: each chart type answers a different question.

**Watch:** [25:20 – 42:30](https://youtu.be/1L420xXpDTg?t=1520)

- [ ] **Steps for making an ML model** — `25:20` · the end-to-end workflow. Why it matters: it is the same shape for every project.
- [ ] **EDA (exploratory data analysis)** — `28:15` · shapes, types, distributions, and correlations. Why it matters: you must look before you model.
- [ ] **Data cleaning** — `33:45` · missing values, duplicates, and wrong types. Why it matters: garbage in is the biggest reason models fail.
- **Deliverable:** run EDA and cleaning on a small CSV of your choice (shape, `info()`, missing-value counts, duplicates removed) and write a short summary, plus Day 5 answers in [`worksheet/day-5.md`](worksheet/day-5.md).

## Day 6 — Saturday 17 Oct 2026 — Preprocessing, feature engineering & selection

**Watch:** [42:30 – 1:01:42](https://youtu.be/1L420xXpDTg?t=2550)

- [ ] **Data preprocessing** — `42:30` · encoding categories and scaling numbers. Why it matters: models only understand numbers.
- [ ] **Feature engineering** — `54:10` · creating new, more useful columns. Why it matters: better features often beat better models.
- [ ] **Feature selection** — `57:58` · dropping what does not help. Why it matters: fewer, better columns reduce noise and overfitting.
- **Deliverable:** take your cleaned CSV from Day 5, encode its categorical columns, scale a numeric column, and drop one weak feature — with a one-line reason for each step, plus Day 6 answers in [`worksheet/day-6.md`](worksheet/day-6.md).

## Day 7 — Sunday 18 Oct 2026 — Foundation projects 1 & 2

**Watch:** [1:01:42 – 2:42:43](https://youtu.be/1L420xXpDTg?t=3702)

- [ ] **Project 1** — `1:01:42` · follow the full foundation project end to end.
- [ ] **Project 2** — `2:07:15` · the second project across the whole workflow.
- [ ] **Rebuild one project on your own dataset** — reuse the same steps on a different CSV so the workflow sticks.
- **Deliverable:** both project notebooks plus the Day 7 answers in [`worksheet/day-7.md`](worksheet/day-7.md).

## Monday 19 Oct 2026 — Review, catch-up, and worksheet completion

- [ ] **Review the week** — read back every day's deliverable and confirm each one runs.
- [ ] **Catch up on anything missed**, using the official library docs and the ML crash course as references.
- [ ] **Complete every day worksheet** you have not finished yet.
- [ ] **Fill the week reflection** at the end of the checklist.
